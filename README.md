# ClientServer App

A simple TCP client server application that uses *threads* and *sockets* in its implementation (client server in the local network) and can be extended. It is a learning project


# What does it do?

It's simple, the server opens a port and the client connects to the server by entering the IP and the port. In this case, the client sends a message to the server and it reverses it! The main function can be changed in the ***main.cpp*** file (server) by passing the functors when instantiating the ***TCPServer*** class
